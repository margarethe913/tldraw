## How tldraw is versioned

Unlike many JavaScript packages distributed on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), the tldraw SDK does not follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) in its release versions. Here's what we do instead:

- Major version bumps are very rare and we reserve them for special changes that signify a paradigm shift of some kind.
- Minor version bumps are released on a regular cadence - approximately monthly. **They may contain breaking changes**. We aim to make breaking changes as minimally disruptive as possible, but tldraw is actively evolving as we add new features. We recommend updating tldraw at a similar pace to our release cadence, and be sure to check the release notes.
- Patch version bumps are for bugfixes and hotfixes that can't wait for the next cadence release.

## Current release: [v3.5.0](/releases/v3.5.0)

Welcome to the 3.5.0 release of tldraw. This month's SDK release improves grid snapping, some usability improvements around layering shapes, and more fine-grained controls around exporting.

## What's new

#### Snap to grid when creating shapes ([#4875](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4875))

This PR makes sure that shapes snap to the grid when created. It adds a `maybeSnapToGrid` function, which can be used to push a shape onto the grid if grid mode is enabled, both when click-creating and when drag-creating.

#### Smart `bringForward`/`sendBackward` ([#4851](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4851))

Improved the 'bring forward' and 'send backward' actions by making them only consider nearby overlapping shapes when deciding the next ordering.

#### Better support scale / quality in export utilities ([#4795](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/pull/4795))

This helps better control the scale when using the image export utilities in tldraw. We now have the option to pass `scale` and `pixelRatio` to the export functions to give more fine-grained control.
